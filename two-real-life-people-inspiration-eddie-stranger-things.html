Eddie van Halen</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>Eddie van Halen was one of the greatest and most well-known guitarists of his time, and of rock and roll as a whole. He was also the founder, songwriter, guitarist and keyboardist for the hard rock band Van Halen. Other original members include drummer Alex van Halen and vocalist David Lee Roth, as well as bassist Michael Anthony, who joined a year after the band was established.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>The band was formed in the 1970s and remained active until Eddie’s death in October 2020. Some of their biggest hits include “Panama,” “Jump,” and the ballad “Can’t Stop Loving You.” The guitarist was also behind the iconic solo in “Beat It” by Michael Jackson.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Aside from his name and the fact that Eddie Munson also plays the guitar, the hairstyle is also similar to the one van Halen had around the time Stranger Things is set. It was quite popular in the hard rock and “hair metal” scenes in the 1980s, and it was worn by musicians like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Bon Jovi</a> as well. The character of Eddie is most likely a reference to that genre as a whole, and an homage to van Halen specifically, because this is the first season released since his death.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>2. Damien Echols (West Memphis Three)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EC34796C-D54F-431F-8CAB-E9EEC1263432.jpeg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Having a metalhead dungeon master as a character is a great opportunity for the Duffer Brothers to explore the Satanic Panic of the 1980s. And that is exactly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what they did</a>. Back then, the metal genre was considered “the devil’s music,” and Dungeons & Dragons players were often ostracized and seen as belonging to a satanic cult.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>For Eddie, already a misfit in Hawkins, things get even more serious when Chrissy, a cheerleader classmate, dies in his trailer. He is immediately seen as the only possible suspect, and the Hellfire Club is then cast as a satanic cult led by him. Even after sacrificing himself in the Upside Down to save the town from Vecna, even after his death, his reputation remains that of a killer connected to the occult.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>The West Memphis Three were a group of teenagers wrongfully accused of the murder of three young boys in the 1990s. Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley were accused of performing a satanic ritual with the kids, then sentenced to death row (Echols) and life imprisonment (Baldwin, Misskelley). There was no evidence to support the accusations made against any of the three, and they were released after a plea deal was made in 2011.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>They were misfits who did not fit into the idea the highly conservative and religious city of Memphis had of what is acceptable, whether for being introverted artists or, in Echols’ case, for listening to metal music. Two of them had been previously arrested for minor crimes such as vandalism, while the other was known to have a strong temper and get into fights at school. All of that made locals see them as the type of people who would end up committing a murder eventually.</p><p data-characters=562 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>For the Duffer Brothers, the three Paradise Lost documentaries, which critically examine the case, were major sources of inspiration, as was the 2012 documentary West of Memphis. They also cite Echols specifically as inspiration. “[Eddie] seemed like a really great character and a means to explore satanic panic, and that’s why that character kind of had tragedy etched all over him,” Matt Duffer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said to Deadline</a>. “Even had he survived the season, you know it wouldn’t have ended well for him. He would have been demonized and blamed for all this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>Another possible nod to the case is the fact that Eddie plays a Metallica song in the Upside Down. Paradise Lost, in 1996, was the first movie Metallica allowed their music to be used in. On Stranger Things, Eddie plays “Master of Puppets” — a feat shared by actor Joseph Quinn and guitarist Tye Trujillo, the son of Metallica’s bassist Rob Trujillo.</p><h3 id=h-bonus-track-eddie-iron-maiden-s-mascot-not-a-real-life-person data-injectable=false><strong>Bonus Track: Eddie, Iron Maiden’s mascot (not a real-life person)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/iron-maiden-eddie.jpg><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Despite his looks and storyline, the first thing that will come to the mind of any metal fan with a metalhead named Eddie is Iron Maiden’s mascot.
