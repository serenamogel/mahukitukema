now makes him 27 years old. He was birthed by his mother Sade Adu and his father Jamaican music producer Bob Morgan in the United Kingdom where he was also brought up as the only child of the singer.</p><p>For the better part, information regarding how Mickailia Ila Adu was brought up remained away from the public domain. In fact, the lights only got to shine on her around 2015 and 2016 when she lifted the veil on Instagram, stating that she was transitioning into becoming a man.</p><p>As a result of this, the early life of the privacy that had earlier surrounded his life, information regarding how he was brought up, and his education have all remained unknown.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Izaak_Theo_Adu_Is_Now_A_Married_Man></span><strong>Izaak Theo Adu Is Now A Married Man</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The transitioning process of Izaak Theo Adu began when she first identified herself as a lesbian and then by late 2015, she decided that she wanted to become a man thus giving birth to Izaak Theo Adu.</p><p>In his many struggles as a trans, Izaak met Emily Margaret Shakeshaft, the woman he came to marry on Instagram. It was revealed that their virtual paths first crossed in 2014 when Emily started following the Adu based on curiosity to keep up with his transition into becoming a man.</p><p>She congratulated him on his trans process in 2019 and told him how proud of him he was. This was because he was the first transman that she was meeting. This started a conversation between them and before long, they started dating. On Nov. 13, 2019, Adu flew to England to meet Emily in California. Soon after, they started living together</p><p>After dating for some time, Izaak engaged Emily in&nbsp; May 2020, and then the pair got married on April 16 2021 in Kona, Hawaii in a very simple and magical private event. The couple took to their social media accounts to make it known that they were now officially man and wife. Sade’s “Babyfather”, a song Maggie grew up listening to, was played at the wedding.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Facts_About_Sade_Adus_Trans_Son></span><strong>Facts About Sade Adu’s Trans Son</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><strong>1.
