He is a capable downfield player who can provide a game-changing presence for the matches he will be playing in the 2023 NFL season. So he should generate a lot of interest from other franchises.</p><p>In 2022, the Cardinals were a huge letdown. Still, they could have performed much better if DeAndre had been available, as we remembered that he was suspended for the first 6 matches of the 2022 regular season for violating the NFL’s PED policy. While he was away, the Cardinals went 2-4, and by the time he was back, the team had looked broken to turn things around. DeAndre finished the 2022 regular season recording&nbsp;717 receiving yards&nbsp;and 3 touchdowns on 64 receptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Cardinals’ struggles could continue into 2023, as the team has parted ways with head coach Kliff Kingsbury, additionally the fact that quarterback Kyler Murray is still recovering from a season-ending injury. Suddenly, the Cardinals do not like an ideal situation for DeAndre.</p><p>And it’s not like DeAndre has plenty of years left. He will be completing 31 by the 2023 season. He is still a potential weapon and is capable of being one of the top options for any team’s passing attack.
