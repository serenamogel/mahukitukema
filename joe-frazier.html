Frazier is perhaps best remembered for his grueling 14-round match against <a href=# class="css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Muhammad Ali</a> in the Philippines, known as the Thrilla in Manila, which Ali won by TKO. Frazier died of liver cancer in 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The youngest of 12 children, boxer Billy Joe Frazier was born on January 12, 1944, in Beaufort, South Carolina. His parents, Rubin and Dolly Frazier, were sharecroppers, so the family never had much money. By the age of 15, Frazier, who'd quit school two years before, was on his own. He moved to New York City to live with an older brother and find work. Employment, however, was hard to come by, and to put cash in his pocket he started stealing cars and selling them to a junkyard in Brooklyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Frazier harbored dreams of doing something with his life. Many of those dreams were built around boxing. As a younger kid, back in South Carolina, he had dreamed of becoming the next Joe Louis, airing out punches at burlap bags he'd filled with leaves and moss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Up north Frazier's love for boxing didn't subside. After moving to Philadelphia, Frazier found work at a slaughterhouse, where he routinely punched sides of beef stored in a refrigerated room. That scene later inspired <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/sylvester-stallone-9491745https://www.biography.com/actor/sylvester-stallone data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sylvester Stallone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sylvester Stallone</a> for his 1976 film, Rocky.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn't until 1961, though, that Frazier entered the ring and actually began to box. He was rough and undisciplined, but his unpolished talent caught the eye of trainer Yank Durham.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Professional Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Under the direction of Durham, who shortened Frazier's punches and added power to his devastating left hook, the young boxer quickly found success. For three straight years, he was the Middle Atlantic Golden Gloves Champion, and he captured the gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He turned pro in 1965 and in just under a year had compiled an 11-0 record. In March 1968 he was crowned heavyweight champion, a result that stemmed in part from Muhammad Ali getting stripped of his heavyweight title the year before, after refusing to be drafted.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1970 Ali successfully sued to get his boxing license back, setting the stage for the sport's highly anticipated matchup between Frazier and Ali.</p><img alt="Muhammad Ali steps away from a punch thrown by boxer Joe Frazier during their heavyweight title fight at Madison Square Garden in 1971.

Frazier steamed at the vocal Ali, who repeatedly called him a "gorilla" and an "Uncle Tom." Years later Frazier's anger still hadn't cooled: After seeing Ali, battling Parkinson's disease, light the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Frazier told reporters he would have liked to have "pushed him in."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Their first battle, dubbed the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/news/muhammad-ali-joe-frazier-fight-of-the-century data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Fight of the Century,"' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"Fight of the Century,"</a> took place at New York's Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971. Despite being lighter and shorter than Ali, Frazier, in front of a packed house that included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/frank-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Sinatra</a> (who photographed the match for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://photoblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/08/8698572-frank-sinatra-photographs-joe-frazier-for-life-magazine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Life magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Life magazine</a>) and Hubert Humphrey, wore Ali down. Frazier took the fight with a unanimous decision, delivering Ali his first professional defeat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The victory catapulted Frazier to full-fledged stardom and riches. He purchased a 368-acre farm not far from where he'd grown up and became the first African American since Reconstruction to speak in front of the South Carolina Legislature.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1974, Frazier, who'd lost his title the year before to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athlete/george-foreman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Foreman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Foreman</a>, stepped into the ring against Ali again. This time it was Ali who came out victorious. Their final battle came in 1975 in the Philippines. Dubbed the Thrilla in Manila, it's considered the sport's greatest fight by some boxing historians. The match lasted 14 bruising rounds before Frazier, battling eyesight issues, was prevented from coming out for the final round by his trainer, Eddie Futch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was the "closest thing to dyin' I know of," Ali later said of the fight.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Final Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1976, at the age of 32, Frazier retired. He briefly returned to the ring in 1981, but quickly retired again, and for good, after just one fight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His post-boxing years saw him manage the career of his oldest son, Marvis, a heavyweight. His daughter, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, also took up boxing and eventually fought Ali's daughter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athlete/laila-ali data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Laila Ali" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Laila Ali</a> in a fight called Ali-Frazier IV. Ali came out victorious.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In all, Frazier had 11 children; sons Marvis, Hector, Joseph Rubin, Joseph Jordan, Brandon Marcus and Derek Dennis and daughters Jacqui, Weatta, Jo-Netta, Renae and Natasha. He and his wife Florence Smith divorced in 1985. Frazier remained with his longtime girlfriend of forty years, Denise Menz, until his death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In September 2011 Frazier was diagnosed with liver cancer. The disease quickly spread, and he soon was in hospice care. He died at his home in Philadelphia on November 7, 2011.</p><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Joe Frazier</li><li>Birth Year: 1944</li><li>Birth date: January 12, 1944</li><li>Birth State: South Carolina</li><li>Birth City: Beaufort</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Joe Frazier was the world heavyweight boxing champion from February 1970 until January 1973 and fought in the famous "Thrilla in Manila" in 1975.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Capricorn</li><li>Death Year: 2011</li><li>Death date: November 7, 2011</li><li>Death State: Pennsylvania</li><li>Death City: Philadelphia</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=34><ul data-node-id=36 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Joe Frazier Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athlete/joe-frazier</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 23, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46jpp5llqeuu7XEqw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./julie-deru.html>&#171;&nbsp;Julie Deru</a>
